# Write the application from its simplest case first

## Status

Ongoing

## Context

It is becoming increasingly and frustratingly hard to create an entire application for which you have limited knowledge about (process distribution, privilege escalation and de-escalation, filesystem handshake operations, etc.) by attacing them all at once. It is best to tackle them one by one and by also making sure that the whole application builds, no matter how shoddy, to be able to see what (language and requirement) constraints could be satisfied.

Addendum 2023-04-08: To expound more on the frustration side, a blocker is much more easily tackled all alone while creating a feature or fix. This is in start contrast with being frustrated by a blocker that exists alongside another when creating an application on a top-to-bottom approach (overall architecture to finer details) as opposed to bottom-up approach (individual pieces and features first until an entire application).

## Decision

The entire project is being rewritten from the ground up, bit by bit, until each problem is addressed by making the application be buildable and properly executable, with tests.

## Progress

- [x] build the basic CRIU operations (8cdf813)
- [x] perform a check on the program if it is running on sudo
- [x] lower privileges (if necessary) on program to be run
  - lowering privileges then re-escalating cannot be done
  - luckily, there's [this](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/os/unix/process/trait.CommandExt.html)
- [x] build an application that is able to call ffmpeg
- [x] create structs for a job
- [x] perform swapping of folders (folder dance)
  - [x] dumping
    - dump state of the process into a directory
    - copy the intermediate files (unfinished video, log files, etc.)
    - remove the old dump and intermediates, if available
    - move the dump and intermediates
  - [x] restoring
    - copy the intermediates into the target directory
    - load the dumps from the dump directory (no need to copy)
  - [x] actually, create a new file for writing procedures of folder dance
- [ ] include the working space into the folder dance
- [ ] standardize the interfaces
- [ ] allow multiple files to be processed, by using pooling
- [ ] utilize sqlite to track down which files must be processed
- [ ] create two executables
  - [ ] one that which will run the jobs and
  - [ ] the other which will provide more jobs to the runner
- [ ] generalize the program to not only use videos
  - [ ] videos
  - [ ] images
  - [ ] shell jobs

## Consequences

My time. Doing this will probably take a considerable amount of time, but it will be less time than wondering how to undo mistakes due to architectural misdecisions.
