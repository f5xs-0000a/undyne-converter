# Detail the roadmap to implement query string parameters for multiple file conversion

## Status

Ongoing (until completely implemented)

Related to [[2023-05-17_adr.md]]

## Motivation

Implementing the specification written in file above is challenging, especially if it were implemented in one sitting. Rather than trying to implement it all at once, perhaps it's best to implement it bit by bit until everything works.

This ADR details the roadmap in order to divide the problem into smaller subproblems that can be tackled with ease.

## Roadmap

- [x] read the URI
- [x] parse the query string parameters
- [ ] create a type\* that abstracts over possible audio channel concatenations and combinations
- [ ] implement the default cases, leaving all the others with an `unimplemented!()`
- [ ] implement all the other cases
    - [ ] case 1
    - [ ] case 2
    - [ ] case 3
- [ ] reimplement the default cases as if they have been passed the abstraction type (read \*)
- [ ] cleanups
