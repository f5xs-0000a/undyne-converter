# Write the application from its simplest case first, part 2: electric boogaloo

## Status

Ongoing

## Context

Consider reading [[2023-04-01_adr.md]] first before here. The motivations for this is the same as the previous.

However, due to the limitations of CRIU or FFMPeg requiring that `/etc/ld.so.cache` not be modified, achieving the previous goal might not be reasonable anymore. Instead, we can do a different approach this time (though to be honest, I should have done this way long ago).

We'll use docker and a lot of async. The architecture will be a client-server model where the server receives requests for conversion and will respond with conversion status. The client will be sending the media required to convert a file and will be waiting until the conversion finishes. Once it finishes, the client will be downloading the media back again.

Running the server in a docker image will allow it to be checkpointed with ease, as provided by docker's features, instead of having to rely on CRIU to checkpoint and restore processes ourselves.

## Progress

- [ ] use axum to create a basic server
- [ ] accept one job
  - [ ] use the endpoint `/convert` for conversion
  - [ ] accept only single videos with a max of one video channel and a max of one audio channel for now
