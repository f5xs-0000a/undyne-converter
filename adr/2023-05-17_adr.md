# Determine how to convert multiple media files for a single job and return a single media file

## Status

Ongoing

## Context

The current conversion tool is able to only convert videos that have one audio channel and one video channel. Real world operations have conversion requests that are more complicated than that.

The conversion tool should be able to convert multiple audio files and multiple video files into a single media file. However, that is not as easy as it sounds. For one, we can have multiple audio files become a single audio file with multiple audio channels. For another, we can have multiple video files become a single video file through concatenation. However that may be, it should be possible for this converter tool to be able to handle concatenations and creating multiple audio channels.

## Decision

There is currently no decision as of yet to create a unified approach to this problem. Only the problem is written so far, not so much for its solution.
